	<h3>Definition</h3>
	<p>The extensive digitization of technology, materials, and processes, and the continuous use of the internet for communication and consumption, have fundamentally changed our lifestyle. 
		The age at which people are first exposed to technology is becoming younger and younger causing children to gain dependence on technology for entertainment. 
		Generations are becoming addicted to technology producing adults that suffer from workaholism. 
		Workaholism refers to the compulsive desire to work. With regards to technology, professionals and managers in the USA, the UK, and Germany found increasing pressures to work more; 
		increased time on the job in the last twenty years; a decline of leisure time; and growing pressures to use technology, in part so that employees can work faster. </p>

	<h3>Justification</h3>
	<p>Due to today’s interconnected society, it can be difficult to dissociate yourself from social media and technology as it seems like a necessity in life. 
		Society norms are quietly forcing people to become dependent on technology in fear of being left out. 
		Therefore, our group felt inspired to understand the impact technology has on our lives, in order to understand the repercussions and impacts this trend can have. </p>
